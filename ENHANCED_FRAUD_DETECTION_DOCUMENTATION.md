# Enhanced Fraud Detection Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The enhanced fraud detection pipeline now includes comprehensive row-level classification capabilities that classify each record from the original dataset as either "good account" or "fraud" with detailed scoring and interpretable reason codes.

## New Features

### 1. Row-Level Classification
- **Enhanced CSV Output**: `fraud_classification_results.csv` contains all original data plus fraud classification
- **Data Lineage Preservation**: Maintains original row mapping throughout the pipeline
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: Each row gets quality scores, risk scores, and confidence levels

### 2. Business Rules Engine
The classification system uses configurable thresholds and business rules:

```python
# Default Classification Thresholds
quality_threshold_low = 3.0      # Below this = likely fraud
quality_threshold_high = 7.0     # Above this = likely good  
anomaly_threshold_high = 3       # Anomaly count threshold for fraud
risk_threshold = 0.5             # Risk score threshold for classification
```

### 3. Enhanced Output Format

The `fraud_classification_results.csv` file includes:

**Original Columns** (preserved from input data):
- `date`, `keyword`, `country`, `browser`, `device`, `ip`
- `publisherId`, `channelId`, `advertiserId`, `feedId`, `userId`
- `isLikelyBot`, `ipClassification`, `isIpDatacenter`, `isIpAnonymous`

**Classification Columns** (newly added):
- `classification`: "good_account" or "fraud"
- `quality_score`: 0-10 scale quality assessment
- `risk_score`: 0-1 probability of fraud
- `confidence`: 0-1 confidence level in classification
- `reason_codes`: Comma-separated list of reason codes
- `temporal_anomaly`: Boolean flag for time-based anomalies
- `geographic_anomaly`: Boolean flag for location-based anomalies  
- `device_anomaly`: Boolean flag for device-based anomalies
- `behavioral_anomaly`: Boolean flag for behavior-based anomalies
- `volume_anomaly`: Boolean flag for volume-based anomalies
- `overall_anomaly_count`: Total count of anomalies detected

## Classification Logic

### Business Rules (Applied in Order)

1. **High Quality + Low Anomalies** â†’ `good_account`
   - Quality score â‰¥ 7.0 AND anomaly count â‰¤ 1
   - Reason: `clean_pattern`
   - Confidence: 0.8

2. **Low Quality + High Anomalies** â†’ `fraud`  
   - Quality score â‰¤ 3.0 AND anomaly count â‰¥ 3
   - Reason: `multiple_indicators`
   - Confidence: 0.9

3. **Bot Activity** â†’ `fraud`
   - `isLikelyBot` = True
   - Reason: `high_bot_activity`
   - Confidence: 0.8

4. **Datacenter IP** â†’ `fraud`
   - `isIpDatacenter` = True  
   - Reason: `datacenter_ip`
   - Confidence: 0.7

5. **Anonymous IP** â†’ `fraud`
   - `isIpAnonymous` = True
   - Reason: `anonymous_ip` 
   - Confidence: 0.6

6. **High Risk Score** â†’ `fraud`
   - Risk score â‰¥ 0.5
   - Confidence: 0.5 + (risk_score * 0.4)

7. **Low Quality Alone** â†’ `fraud`
   - Quality score â‰¤ 3.0
   - Reason: `low_quality_score`
   - Confidence: 0.6

8. **Multiple Anomalies** â†’ `fraud`
   - Anomaly count â‰¥ 3
   - Reason: `multiple_indicators`
   - Confidence: 0.7

### Risk Score Calculation

The risk score is calculated using a weighted ensemble approach:

```python
risk_score = (
    0.4 * quality_risk +      # Inverted quality score (0-1)
    0.3 * anomaly_risk +      # Normalized anomaly count (0-1)  
    0.15 * bot_risk +         # Bot indicator (0 or 1)
    0.15 * ip_risk            # IP-based risk factors (0-1)
)
```

### Reason Codes

The system provides interpretable reason codes for each classification:

**Fraud Reasons:**
- `high_bot_activity`: Bot behavior detected
- `datacenter_ip`: IP address from datacenter
- `anonymous_ip`: Anonymous/proxy IP detected
- `suspicious_ip_pattern`: IP classified as suspicious/malicious
- `low_quality_score`: Quality score below threshold
- `multiple_indicators`: Multiple fraud indicators present
- `temporal_anomaly`: Time-based pattern anomaly
- `geographic_anomaly`: Location-based pattern anomaly
- `device_anomaly`: Device-based pattern anomaly
- `behavioral_anomaly`: Behavior-based pattern anomaly
- `volume_anomaly`: Volume-based pattern anomaly

**Good Account Reasons:**
- `clean_pattern`: No significant fraud indicators
- `insufficient_data`: Not enough data for confident classification

### Running the Enhanced Pipeline

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source /home/fiod/shimshi/venv/bin/activate

# Run with enhanced classification
python main_pipeline_optimized.py \
    --data-path "/path/to/data.csv" \
    --output-dir "/path/to/output/" \
    --approximate  # For faster processing
```

### Output Files

```python
from fraud_classifier import FraudClassifier

classifier = FraudClassifier(
    quality_threshold_low=2.5,     # More sensitive to low quality
    quality_threshold_high=8.0,    # Higher bar for "good" accounts
    anomaly_threshold_high=2,      # Lower anomaly tolerance
    risk_threshold=0.4             # Lower risk tolerance
)
```
