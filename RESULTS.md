## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Quality Scoring Analysis

The quality scoring model evaluated each channel based on multiple fraud indicators:

#### Top 5 High-Risk Channels

| Channel ID | Quality Score | Bot Rate | Volume | Risk Factors |
|------------|---------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| ch_0023... | 1.91 | 99.4% | 938 | High bot rate |
| ch_0002... | 2.06 | 42.2% | 420 |  |
| ch_0036... | 3.10 | 72.0% | 633 | High bot rate, High fraud score |
| ch_0012... | 4.10 | 29.2% | 371 | High fraud score |
| ch_0050... | 4.16 | 90.1% | 42 | High bot rate |


#### Top 5 High-Quality Channels

| Channel ID | Quality Score | Bot Rate | Volume | Strengths |
|------------|---------------|----------|--------|----------|
| ch_0034... | 9.96 | 85.0% | 833 | High volume |
| ch_0003... | 9.89 | 33.9% | 225 | High volume |
| ch_0097... | 9.82 | 38.2% | 565 | High volume, Diverse IPs |
| ch_0010... | 9.74 | 63.7% | 68 |  |
| ch_0022... | 9.68 | 52.1% | 963 | High volume, Diverse IPs |


### 2. Anomaly Detection Results

The anomaly detection system identified unusual patterns across multiple dimensions:

#### Anomaly Type Distribution

- **Behavioral Anomaly**: 30 channels
- **Temporal Anomaly**: 22 channels
- **Geographic Anomaly**: 12 channels
- **Volume Anomaly**: 12 channels
- **Device Anomaly**: 5 channels

#### Most Anomalous Channels

| Channel ID | Anomaly Count | Anomaly Types |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| ch_0028... | 3 | temporal, geographic, volume |
| ch_0035... | 3 | temporal, behavioral, volume |
| ch_0047... | 3 | temporal, device, behavioral |
| ch_0004... | 2 | temporal, device |
| ch_0018... | 2 | geographic, volume |
